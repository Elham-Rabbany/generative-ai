It actually takes about 365.24 days for the Earth to orbit the sun. By adding an extra day every four years, we account for those extra quarter days, keeping our calendar in alignment with Earth's orbit.\n",

            "Human: What happens if we didn't have leap years?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Without leap years, our calendar would slowly drift out of alignment with the Earth's orbit around the sun. Over centuries, this would mean that seasons would shift in our calendar. For example, after about 76 years, our calendar would be off by about one day, and after 3600 years, it would be off by about 24 days. This would significantly disrupt the accuracy of our timekeeping and seasonal predictions.\n",
